## Usage
You can use the main.py file to interact with the Habit Tracker through the command-line interface.

### Commands

1. Add a new habit:
   ```bash
   python main.py add "habit_name" periodicity [--custom_frequency N] [--grace_period N]
   ```
* habit_name: The name of the habit (can be multiple words)
* periodicity: Can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
* --custom_frequency: Optional, number of days for a custom frequency
* --grace_period: Optional, the number of grace days allowed for streak continuation

    #### Example:
    ```bash 
    python main.py add "exercise" daily --grace_period 1
    ```

2. Complete a habit:
    ```bash 
   python main.py complete "habit_name"

     #### Example:
    ```bash 
    python main.py complete "exercise"
   ```
   
3. List all habits:
    ```bash
    python main.py list-habits
   ```
4. List habits by periodicity:
   ```bash
    python main.py list-by-periodicity periodicity
   ```
   #### Example:
    ```bash
   python main.py list-by-periodicity daily
   ```
5. View the longest streak across all habits:
    ```bash
   python main.py longest-streak
   ```
6. View the longest streak for a specific habit:
   ```bash
   python main.py longest-streak-for-habit "habit_name"
   ```
7. Edit a habit:
   ```bash
   python main.py edit "old_name" "new_name" new_periodicity [--custom_frequency N] [--grace_period N]
   ```
8. Delete a habit:
   ```bash 
   python main.py delete "habit_name"
   ```
9. View a habitâ€™s completion history:
    ```bash
   python main.py view-history "habit_name"
   ```
10. View the available commands:
    ```bash
    python main.py menu
    ```
    
## Running Tests
Unit tests are included to verify the core functionality of the Habit Tracker.

### To run the tests:
```bash
python -m unittest test_habit_tracker.py
```
### The tests will:
* Validate the creation and management of habits
* Ensure streak calculations are accurate
* Verify that the predefined habit data is correctly initialized and tracked
